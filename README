# newstile

newstile is yet-another-markdown-parser but fast, pure Ruby, using a strict syntax definition and
supporting several common extensions.

The syntax definition can be found in doc/syntax.page, a quick reference in doc/quickref.page. All
the documentation is available online at http://newstile.rubyforge.org.


# Usage

newstile has a basic *Cloth API, so using newstile is as easy as

    require 'newstile'

    Newstile::Document.new(text).to_html


# Development

Just clone the git repository as described in doc/installation.page you are good to go. You probably
want to install `rake` so that you can use the provided rake tasks. Aside from that:

* The `tidy` binary needs to be installed for the automatically derived tests to work.
* The `latex` binary needs to be installed for the latex-compilation tests to work.
